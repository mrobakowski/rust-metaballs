# rust-metaballs

This is an old project of mine done for a graphics course at Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology.

It was written in an old version of rust and it ~~no longer~~ compiles.

Controls:
  * **WASD** - forward, left, backward, right
  * **Space** - up
  * **LShift** - down
  * **Q** - add a metaball
  * **E** - remove a metaball
  * **Scroll** - control the passage of time
  * **R** + **Scroll** - change metaball grid resolution
  * **LCtrl** + **Scroll** - change fov
  * **RMB** + **Mouse move** - move the camera
